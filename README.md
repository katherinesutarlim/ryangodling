# Inspiration
This project is based on the idea that most subscribtions for services are very tiring and infuriating to cancel. We take it up a notch by desigining a series of challenges in the form of minigames that the user must face in order to cancel the subscribtion.

The product to be subscribed would be a subscribtion to Ryan Gosling or, as we call him, Ryan Godling. To unsubscribe from him, you, as mentioned, would face a series of ordeals to reach your final destination - cancelling the subscribtion.

# Credit
This project is designed for the Terrible Ideas Hackathon - Sydney branch. You can visit the website [here](https://terriblehack.com/events/syd/).

The idea for the project comes from Katherine Sutarlim and Astrid Bina, with the help from a newly-converted believer Tung Quan Hoang.

The assets (images for the minigames) mainly comes from the Internet, most of which are photoshopped and redesigned by Astrid and Katherine. Some other images are generated by Midjourney AI. Many of the paragraphs and dialogues for some games are generated by ChatGPT.

# Tech Stack
The entire website is designed in ReactJS.
