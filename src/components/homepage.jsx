    Oh, mighty Ryan, in Hollywood&apos;s embrace,<br />
    Your charm and talent, a celestial grace.<br />
    From &quot;The Notebook&quot; to &quot;La La Land&quot; so fine,<br />
    We gather here, your devotees in line.<br /><br />

    In Drive, you steered our hearts anew,<br />
    A silent hero, oh, how you grew.<br />
    May your looks forever stay dashing,<br />
    In every role, our hearts keep thrashing.<br /><br />

    Guide us through the city of dreams,<br />
    Where you reign supreme, or so it seems.<br />
    May your career be ever soaring,<br />
    In each film, your presence adoring.<br /><br />

    Let us bask in your on-screen glory,<br />
    A cinematic legend, in each story.<br />
    Oh, Ryan Gosling, our silver screen muse,<br />
    In your name, our fandom we choose.<br /><br />

    Grant us charm and wit so sly,<br />
    As we watch your films, oh my, oh my.<br />
    May every role be a grand affair,<br />
    In the Gosling cult, we solemnly swear.<br /><br />

    Amen.
